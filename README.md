# CodeWars

I love this website. Leetcode is very similar but I was introduced to Codewars first by my brother Richard. It has really helped shape my own learning and build my confidence in coding. I will be putting my solutions in this repo for my own reference and anyone else who wants to see my methods of solving different problems with code!

Here is my codewars profile:

I invite anyone to follow me and I'll return follow. I'd love to discuss what the best practices of coding are and what they ought to be as well as coding and best learning strats. Message me on my LinkedIn:

Happy Coding!
