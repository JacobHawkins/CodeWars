# CodeWars
I love this website. Leetcode is very similar but I was introduced to Codewars first by my brother Richard. It has really helped shape my own learning and build my confidence in coding. I will be putting my solutions in this repo for my own reference and anyone else who wants to see my methods of solving different problems with code!
